---------------------

We have implemented a RPN calculator by using our raspberry pi 0 to manipulate our matrix keypad and oled screen. We have also built a library for the oled screen.


<h1 align="center"> Instructions to run </h1>


1. Compile and Install Library: Run <mark>cd oled_lib </mark>, then run <mark>python setup.py</mark>
2. Now you can run the main file using <mark>python main.py</mark>
